### Mid-Semester Project: Museum of Fine Arts

Visit the Museum of Fine Arts and explore its Art of the Americas wing, then select one item from their collection of art that you can connect to the core question of this course: "What does it mean to be an American?" You will write an essay analyzing the piece of art within the larger context of American identity and American history. [Use this document as a template]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/MFA_Project.docx), change the filename to `Lastname_MFA_Project.docx` (ex. `Blevins_MFA_Project.docx`), and upload it to [this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/request/ujVENh5ZJHNtq7ikxZW5).

**Cover Page**

Include the following information on the first page of your essay:

1. Insert an image of the piece of art at the beginning of your essay. Try to find as high-quality an image as possible.
2. The "basics" of the work of art: title, artist, date created, medium (oil painting, sculpture, etc.), and brief description of its content.

**Essay** 

In 1,000-1,200 words, analyze the work of art you've selected and its relationship to U.S. history. Your essay should cover the following:

1. What **message or interpretation** about American identity/history might a visitor take away from this work of art? How does it convey it? Is it through the person/event/object depicted? The artist's biography? Something else? Be specific.
2. Provide **historical context** for the work of art and its message about American identity/history. What additional information would help a visitor to the MFA better understand this work of art and its message? Incorporate specific examples from class lectures and/or readings, along with outside research. Cite your work using footnotes (see below).
3. Situate the work of art **within the MFA's Art of the Americas wing**. Some questions to consider: What gallery/exhibit is it part of and what other kinds of art and artists are nearby? Is it shown prominently or in a side room? What kinds of people, events, or artists do you see and what is missing? How does this surrounding context connect to your piece of art's message about American identity/history? 

**Footnotes**

Each time you refer to a reading, lecture, or other source in your essay, insert a footnote at the end of that paragraph that documents the source(s) you used. There is no minimum number of sources you need to reference and you can use whatever official citation style you are most comfortable with. If you have not used footnotes before, follow the Chicago Manual of Style's guidelines for notes: <https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html>. You will not be penalized for formatting mistakes provided that you are giving as much information as possible: author, title, publication/website, date, page number, URL, etc. The idea is that the reader needs to be able to understand where the information is coming from and, when possible, go back and consult that source itself. Do not include your footnotes in the essay's total word count.
