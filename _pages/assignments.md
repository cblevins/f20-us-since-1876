### Participation and Attendance (20%)

Students are to attend each class having completed the readings or other assignments and be prepared to discuss them. Students should check in with their assigned TA to note their attendance before taking their seat. Your grade will be based on your contributions to in-class activities and discussions, how you interact with your peers during class, whether you have brought the readings or required material to class, and arriving on-time. 

Your participation grade will also include a number of short quizzes that will be administered throughout the semester. These are meant as a check-in to make sure you are engaging with the course's material, including lectures, readings, and in-class activities. Unless otherwise notified, you will not need to study for these outside of: a) doing the reading, and b) taking notes and paying attention during class. If you happen to be absent during one of these quizzes, the scores from your other quizzes will be weighted more heavily. 

### Citizenship Portfolio (25%)

One of the major themes of this course is American citizenship and the relationship between the past and the present. As part of this theme, you will be completing a Citizenship Portfolio in which you link some of the big topics in U.S. history to modern-day issues and events related to citizenship today.

1. Complete a voting worksheet during the lead-up to the mid-term elections.  (5%)
2. Attend an immigration detainee hearing and write a response about your experience. (10%)
3. 2020 Democratic Primary: During the course of the semester the Democratic Party will be having a series of primaries. Each of you will be responsible for "covering" one state's primary. You will research the particular rules and regulations around that primary, the political history of that state, what is expected to happen, and then report on the results of the primary. (5%) *Due one week after your democratic primary*

Please note that these assignments *cannot* be completed at the last minute and are subject to outside schedules that are beyond your own control. They will require you to plan ahead several days or even weeks to figure out when you can complete them. [Full description of the assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/citizenship-portfolio).

### Midterm Project (20%)

### Final Project (20%)

"What does it mean to be an American?” In your final project, you will be presenting some kind of historical interpretation or narrative that addresses the core question of the course. You might focus on what it meant to be an American during an event, period or episode in American history, for instance, or how American identity today is shaped by some particular historical process or event. Your project must take the format of an “unessay,” or any project format besides a traditional final paper. You can create a sculpture, podcast episode, restaurant menu, board game, meme collage, website, piece of historical fictional - whatever you want! 

Regardless of the format, the major requirement is that you must present *a historically based analysis and interpretation that is supported by both primary and secondary sources.* The interpretation must be clearly and compellingly articulated (written, painted, sung, etc.) and incorporate some kind of historical perspective. The very best unessays will demonstrate not only solid analysis, but creativity in how that interpretation is presented. Each analysis will include an annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources and a short written introduction that gives an overview or any necessary explanation of the project.
