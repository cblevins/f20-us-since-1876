### Final Project: Course Packet

In your final project of the semester you will choose any topic that interests you (ex. fashion, impeachment, birth control, U.S. holidays, Chinese-American immigration, etc.), research its history in the United States over the 1900s and/or 2000s, and then create a "course packet" of ten historical sources related to that topic. The goal of this project is to develop in-depth knowledge of a specific topic and then use that knowledge to *curate* a set of sources that present a coherent historical interpretation, narrative, or story. Think of yourself as a professor making a course packet for students to read who are unfamiliar with this topic, or a museum curator building an exhibition. You will also write a 1,000-1,2000 word essay that: a) provides any necessary background information about your topic, b) presents your interpretation, and c) contextualizes your topic within larger themes of U.S. history. Finally, you will include a bibliography of secondary sources (academic articles, books, etc.) that you consulted while researching your topic.

The best projects will:
 
- Use a variety of engaging sources (visual, written, etc.)
- Be deeply researched (ie. more than a few Google searches and Wikipedia articles)
- Offer a clear, compelling, and coherent historical interpretation, narrative, or story in both the introduction and the historical sources
- Demonstrate creativity in the choice of topic, sources and/or interpretation

Submit a single Word document formatted as `YourLastName_FinalProject.docx` (ie. `Blevins_FinalProject.docx`) to the following [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/request/5MaY1gI5vUaNYhNFdBLp). Your document should include the following elements:

- Student Name and Title of Course Packet
- Introductory Essay (1,000-1,200 words)
- Bibliography of Secondary Sources
- 10 historical sources inserted as images
- Each source should include identifying information for the source (ex. author, title, date created, etc.) and 2-3 sentence explanations of each source.
