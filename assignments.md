### Participation and Attendance (20%)

Students are to attend each class having completed the readings or other assignments and be prepared to discuss them. Your grade will be based on your contributions to in-class activities and discussions, how you interact with your peers during class, whether you have brought the readings or required material to class, and arriving on-time. Your participation grade will also include a number of short quizzes that will be administered throughout the semester. These are meant as a check-in to make sure you are engaging with the course's material, including lectures, readings, and in-class activities. Unless otherwise notified, you will not need to study for these outside of: a) doing the reading, and b) taking notes and paying attention during class. If you happen to be absent during one of these quizzes, the scores from your other quizzes will be weighted more heavily. 

### Citizenship Portfolio (25%)

One of the major themes of this course is American citizenship and the relationship between the past and the present. As part of this theme, you will be completing a Citizenship Portfolio in which you link some of the big topics in U.S. history to modern-day issues and events related to citizenship today.
